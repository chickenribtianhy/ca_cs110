to inform the assembler that we want to put the following content into this segment
.data indicates that the following content would be stored in static segment, denotes where global variables are declared
.text indicates that the following content would be stored in code segment, indicates the start of the code.
.word store listed value as unaligned 32-bit words, allocates and initializes space for a 4-byte variable in the data segment.

34, representing the 9-th fib

0x10000010
refer to t3(x28), or in memory(data) as well

break 0x10, change 9 to d




t0(x5)

t1 is source, t2 is dest

loop:
	slli t3, t0, 2
	add t4, t1, t3
	lw t5, 0(t4)
	beq t5, x0, exit
	add t6, t2, t3
	sw t5, 0(t6)
	addi t0, t0, 1
	jal x0, loop

The slli instruction computes an offset from the start of the address of an array, stored in t0. 
This offset represents k, after times 4, then added to t1 and t2, we have the address from which we want to load word.
